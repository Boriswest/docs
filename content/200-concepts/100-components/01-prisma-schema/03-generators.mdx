<TopBlock>

A Prisma schema can have one or more generators, represented by the [`generator`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#generator) <span class="api"></span> block:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated/prisma-client-js"
}
```

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command. The main property `provider` defines which **Prisma Client (language specific)** is created - currently, only `prisma-client-js` is available. Alternatively you can define any npm package that follows our generator specification. Additionally and optionally you can define a custom output folder for the generated assets with `output`.

## Prisma Client: `prisma-client-js`

The generator for Prisma's JavaScript Client accepts multiple additional properties:

- `previewFeatures`: [Preview features](/concepts/components/preview-features) to include
- `binaryTargets`: Engine binary targets for `prisma-client-js` (for example, `debian-openssl-1.1.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 18+, or `native` if you are working locally)

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["sample-preview-feature"]
  binaryTargets   = ["linux-musl"]
}
```

### Binary targets

Prisma Client JS (`prisma-client-js`) uses several [engines](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). Engines are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma in the form of executable, platform dependent engine files. Depending on which platform you are executing your code on, you need the correct file. "Binary targets" are used to define which files should be present for the target platform(s).

The correct file is particularly important when [deploying](/guides/deployment/deploy-prisma) your application to production, which often differs from your local development environment.

#### The `native` binary target

The `native` binary target is special. It doesn't map to a concrete operating system. Instead, when `native` is specified in `binaryTargets`, Prisma detects the _current_ operating system and automatically specifies the correct binary target for it.

As an example, assume you're running **macOS** and you specify the following generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

In that case, Prisma detects your operating system and finds the right binary file for it based on the [list of supported operating systems](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) <span class="api"></span>.
If you use macOS Intel x86 (`darwin`), then the binary file that was compiled for `darwin` will be selected.
If you use macOS ARM64 (`darwin-arm64`), then the binary file that was compiled for `darwin-arm64` will be selected.

> **Note**: The `native` binary target is the default. You can set it explicitly if you wish to [include additional binary targets for deployment to different environments](/guides/deployment/use-prisma-with-serverless-framework#binary-targets-in-schemaprisma).

## Community generators

If you want to create your own generator, you can use the [`create-prisma-generator`](https://github.com/YassinEldeeb/create-prisma-generator) CLI built by our community member [Yassin Eldeep](https://github.com/YassinEldeeb).

> **Note**: Community projects are not maintained or officially supported by Prisma and some features may be out of sync. Use at your own discretion. If you create a community generator, please use this naming convention: `prisma-generator-<custom-name>`.

You can find a complete list of community generators on the [Prisma Ecosystem](https://www.prisma.io/ecosystem) page.

If you have built your own generator, you can submit your package in this [form](https://prisma103696.typeform.com/to/DYEjFIVx). We will review your submission and add it to the Prisma Ecosystem page.
